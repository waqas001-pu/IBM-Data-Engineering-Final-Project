# 🎓 IBM Data Engineering Final Project — NoSQL Data Engineering for a Consulting Firm

## 📘 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate**.  
The goal was to simulate a **data engineering consulting task** involving the movement, querying, and transformation of data between two **NoSQL databases** — **MongoDB** and **Cassandra**.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Import and query data in **MongoDB**
- Export filtered datasets from MongoDB
- Create a keyspace and tables in **Cassandra**
- Import data into Cassandra using the **COPY** command
- Perform analytical queries in both databases

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Database Administration** (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- **ETL Operations**
- **Query Optimization**
- **Data Migration between NoSQL Databases**
- **Shell Scripting & Command-Line Tools**
- **Data Modeling**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **MongoDB**
- **Cassandra**
- **Skills Network Cloud IDE**
- **CQL & Mongo Queries**
- **CSV / JSON Data Handling**
